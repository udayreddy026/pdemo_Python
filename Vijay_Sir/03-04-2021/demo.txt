Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents (including having malformed markup, i.e. non-closed tags, so named after tag soup). It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML,[2] which is useful for web scraping.[1]
Beautiful Soup was started by Leonard Richardson, who continues to contribute to the project,[3] and is additionally supported by Tidelift, a paid subscription to open-source maintenance.[4]
It is available for Python 2.7 and Python 3.

#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Anchor extraction from HTML document
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.request import urlopen
with urlopen('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page') as response:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response, 'html.parser')
    for anchor in soup.find_all('a'):
        print(anchor.get('href', '/'))
